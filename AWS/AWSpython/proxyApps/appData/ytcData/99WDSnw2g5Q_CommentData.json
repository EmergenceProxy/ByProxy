Sewing the seeds of doubt, as if there are other plausible reasons for Mr. Garcia, the Maryland Dad and fine upstanding person,\nto mark himself that way, total accident.\nHe tripped and the ink got on his skin, and it won't rub off. Amazing.\nConsider a Natty database of Gang Violence policing in L.A. alone has troves of this same pattern,  as identifying markers amongst the Gang Banging Drug Traffickers en masse.\nEver hear of Bayesian Statistics? Keep in mind that Mr. Garcia's knuckle tattoos are only ONE component in the statistical probability of his being a member of MS13 & a \"Maryland Dad\" concurrently.\n\"Captain Carotene\" having 78yr old opinions are correct, even if  being taken literally word for word is a GOTCHA moment;  it doesn't change the symbols on Mr. Garcia's tattooed knuckles.\nWhat if this interpretation of the symbols is the correct one? Would that matter ? \n\nOne thing is statistically apparent: The TDS is Strong on this comments thread.",

Of course he actually believes this.  I guarantee the person who gave him the picture told him that's what the tattoos represent (even though they don't, it's way more plausible), but he either forgot or didn't listen and got it in his head that this was an ACTUAL picture of his tattoos, labels and all.\n\nHe's just so fucking delusional.  Prices are not down, gas prices are not down, and how in the fuck does he expect tourism to do well when foreigners are being deported left and right regardless of legal status?  There have been so many stories now of foreigners being either indefinitely detained or outright kicked out for coming into our country.  Does he not follow what's going on?  I'd be surprised if he even knows about any of it.  He surrounds himself with only people who tell him what he wants to hear and who praise him and only watches positive coverage of himself.",

        "text": "Of course it's possible. The basic counterargument is Hanlons razor: Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence. Stupid is more likely than evil. \nAnd treating Trump as a fool rather than as an evil genious has been a far more reliable way to explain and predict his behaviour.\nOf course he could also just be lying here just to not admit that he was wrong there. But then, you have the choice between lack of intelligence (he actually believes what he says) and a lack of maturity (he can't admit he was wrong) of practically equal magnitude. He's a fool either way, differentiating what kind of fool has little practical value.",

I think he\u2019s lying here in order to tell his base and right wing media what to believe and what to say. That was the intention by editing this photo and releasing it from the very beginning. He just needs an excuse to defy the Supreme Court, and showing \u201cproof\u201d that he was a gang member is enough to excuse bypassing due process, knowing the cult is dumb enough to believe it. I don\u2019t know if it matters so much at this late point, but I think that criticisms in the media since 2016 of Trump having dementia or being crazy has been unhelpful or counterproductive from the beginning, when in fact he is trying to manipulate the media and his base, knowing much of what he is saying is false. I think it\u2019s an important difference and everyone should understand the mechanics of why we have a dangerous cult.",

I\u2019m 50/50 if it\u2019s gang symbolism but I thought about it, that still doesn\u2019t matter in this specific case with no evidence of him being in a gang or that gang even existing in the state he lives.\n\nAre people with no record with dipset tattoos liable just cuz they thought Camron was cool?",

        "text": "Ryan says, \"I want to know who is lying to him.\" Maybe someone is, maybe \"no one\" is knowingly lying to him. Most, not all of these people claim to be born again Christians, so I will first present the biblical answer and preface that by saying not only do they openly reject truth when it is science, they do the same regularly with the Bible, both by saying, \"That no longer applies,\" which we see all the time, but also in another much more important way to this discussion. I have shown these people directly from the Bible that they are absolutely wrong because this passage says the exact opposite from what they are claiming as truth. Most give that first answer, but some are so divorced from reality they will tell me, \"See? It says exactly what I told you.\"  \n\nThe biblical explanation for this is \"powerful delusion\" and that delusion is sent by God onto those who have already fully deluded themselves, so that they simply cannot be convinced until their own lies have fully destroyed them. The psychological explanation is denial and delusion.  Maybe Trump and those with whom he has surrounded himself are being lied to, but more likely they are so far gone that they cannot see truth, no matter how strong the evidence that proves the lie. Also, they have enough sycophants around them that are all too willing to manufacture the \"proof\" that their lies are facts, whether those people are also deluded or simply sycophantic. \n\nIt is possible someone is lying to Trump; it is not necessary for anyone to be knowingly lying to Trump. He is probably far enough gone that he does not need anyone to lie to him.  It may still help if he has a tiny bit of conscience left, but I doubt it is at all necessary.",

Fyi Trump also has a base of educated wealthy well travelled people voting him in, who are never spoken of in the narrative. But I've met these people, in multiple states and other countries. This said, know that his 'followers' are a range as wide as the income and education of Democrats. To be ignorant of this, or ignore it conveniently, is the divide that is so easily manufactured and manipulated in the public square, distracting us all from the few actually controlling geopolitics and marching us into a futuristic feudal system. \nPS I'm not a Trump fan or a Republican, and feel the Democrats have lost their minds and integrity on numerous counts.",

It would be great to have another conservative who\u2019s not a giggly teenager.",

We haven't even reached the full capacity of AI generated images and deep fakes yet so I imagine stuff like this could start creating legit mental problems for people.\n\nSociety should definitely be concerned about what the future holds and perhaps less so on what they are being spoon fed at the moment.",

I found nothing. This clearly is guesses or made up. Presented as facts to change the public opinion. However it is irrelevant. The guy is not convicted of any crimes on the US or El Salvador. No one should be sent to a gulag without any chance to prove ones innocence. And I find it bizarre that people is ok with sending anyone to a gulag for life for having a tattoo. Even if it says ms13. They could just deport him. Why put him in jail for life? How many other people without any crimes committed have been incarcerated? Why don't you understand that without due process no one is safe. They just have to say that you are a terrorist and that's it. Maga is full of unwanted individuals. It's just a matter of time before they start coming for you as well if they get away with this. Americans are in a  very bad situation. I hope you manage to solve it. You have been treated as shit for so long by both partys and their corporate overlords. But now it's on whole other level.
